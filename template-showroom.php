                <p>For over thirty years, Light World has been focused on refining the lighting experience for its customers.</p>
                <p>Founded in 1989 by Joy, Light World’s first location was in a Holland Strip Mall with a store size of only 1,500 square feet.</p>
                <p>Since then, Light World has outgrown three locations and has found its current home at a 13,000 sq. ft. showroom and warehouse in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania. This facility gave Light World a superior focus on customer service and an inspiring selection, as well as an entrance into a thriving e-commerce market.</p>
                <p>Light World also is a member of LIGHTING ONE, a co-op of lighting showrooms across the country. This association allows Light World to give its customers the lowest prices in the industry, and access to private label product exclusive to its showroom.</p>
                <p>We know that your choice matters when it comes to a perfect Lighting Solution, and Light World is committed to making sure you find it!</p>

                        <p>Joy started her career as a commercial lighting representative. Shortly after, she fell in love with the challenge, the fast pace and the never-ending chance for knowledge and experience. Joy’s early career allowed her to visit most of the United States, and much of the world. However, after many years, Joy felt it was time to put the suitcases away and grow some roots in the community. In 1989, Joy opened her first store and called it “Light World”. Four stores, two recessions, one flood, many wonderful clients and friends later and she wouldn’t change a thing. In her little bit of free time, she loves challenging her husband Peter on the golf course and riding bikes on the boardwalk!</p>
